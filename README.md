## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Gemini API key (get one at [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev))

### Installation

1. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash

   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   # or
   venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   Or install individually if you encounter issues:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit google-generativeai plotly matplotlib
   ```

4. **Get your Gemini API key**

## Technical Details

### AI Integration
- Uses Google's Gemini Pro model for analysis
- Optimized prompts for structured output
- JSON-based response parsing for reliability

### Bias Detection Categories
- Gender/Sex
- Age  
- Race/Ethnicity

- Disability
- Education Background
- Socioeconomic Status
- Appearance
- Personal Life

### Visualizations
- Plotly charts for interactive bias category analysis
- Word clouds for suspicious phrase visualization
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Limitations

- Requires internet connection for Gemini API calls
- Analysis quality depends on transcript clarity and completeness
- Bias detection is AI-powered and may not catch all subtle biases
- Free Gemini API has rate limits

## Privacy & Ethics

- No interview data is stored permanently
- API calls are made directly to Google's servers
- Tool is designed to promote fair hiring, not replace human judgment
- Should be used as a supplementary aid, not the sole decision-making tool

## Troubleshooting

**"API key not configured" error**
- Make sure you've entered your Gemini API key in the sidebar
- Verify the key is valid and has proper permissions

**"Analysis failed" error**  
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your API key hasn't exceeded rate limits
- Try with a shorter transcript

**Charts not displaying**
- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
- Try refreshing the page

**Package installation issues**
- Use a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
- Install packages individually if batch installation fails
- Update pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
